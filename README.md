# Predicting_Diabetes_using_Logical_Regression_-_Decision_tree_algorithms_ML_Python
Logistic Regression is one of the most simple and commonly used Machine Learning algorithms for two-class classification. It describes and estimates the relationship between one dependent binary variable and independent variables. Linear regression gives you a continuous output, but logistic regression provides a constant output. The logistic function is a sigmoid function, which takes any real value between zero and one. 

Decision tree is a basic classification and regression method. Decision tree model has a tree structure, which can describe the process of classification instances based on features. It can be considered as a set of if-then rules, which also can be thought of as conditional probability distributions defined in feature space and class space.
